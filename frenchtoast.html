<h2>Description</h2>
<p>French toast, a beloved breakfast classic, transforms simple ingredients into a decadent delight. Thick slices of bread are soaked in a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, and a hint of cinnamon, infusing them with rich flavor and a custard-like texture. Cooked to golden perfection on a griddle or skillet, French toast emerges with a crisp exterior and a soft, pillowy center. Its versatility shines as it can be enjoyed simply with a drizzle of maple syrup or adorned with a myriad of toppings such as fresh fruit, powdered sugar, or a dollop of whipped cream. Whether served as a leisurely weekend brunch or a quick weekday indulgence, French toast never fails to comfort and satisfy with its warm, comforting embrace.</p>
